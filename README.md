Sharing is increasingly essential to both the privilege of an individual as well as business endeavors within modern times. The exchange of significant company papers, teaming up on educational projects, or just using electronic information to remain in touch with loved ones—the movement of information between digital platforms has become a regular occurrence. The growing dependence on digitization for communication highlights the urgent need for effective and safe transmission of file techniques.
1.	While conventional file transmission techniques may be useful for mankind throughout decades, their drawbacks have grown more apparent given the vast yet ever-evolving world of technology nowadays. The previous prevalence of many operational systems on various platforms, ranging from iOS and Android to Windows and macOS, contributes to an obvious problem: platform reliance. Plenty of the file transfer programs that are now in use are system-specific and hence useless when used across devices. Therefore, restriction merely annoys consumers yet additionally renders it more difficult for technological relationships that occur naturally between various consumer categories along with settings.
2.	 Additionally, there also occurred an obvious rise in the overall sophistication of various traditional transmission of file methods. Individuals frequently struggle with complex UI or perplexing operations, less tech-savvy individuals. Such programs often have a lengthy education process, which may trigger dissatisfaction as well as decreased efficiency. The previous core of the successful transmission of files gets masked by the level of detail, which also lessens the total experience for users.
3.	A further component of this complex issue is safety, which is of utmost importance in the modern digital world. Strong protection procedures throughout the transmission of files are vital, as seen by the rise in cybersecurity assaults. Although most of the present offerings try to provide safe transmission choices, most frequently are unable to deliver complete security across the always-changing array of cyber threats. This weakness puts organizations that depend on the encrypted transmission of confidential data for everyday purposes in jeopardy in addition to individual clients that consume it.
This study aims to create a transmission of file technology that can be used on several platforms. The framework will prioritize security and improve the consumer's satisfaction while exchanging electronic data. Figure 1 shows PyLink's simple, easy-to-use layout. This obvious distinction between 'Send' and 'Receive' solves client issues with transferring file complexities. The switches for actions are centrally placed for simple access regardless of non-technical individuals. PyLink's dedication to the smooth sharing of documents is seen by its aesthetic minimalism and compatibility alongside Google authentication.
 
1.2. Aim
